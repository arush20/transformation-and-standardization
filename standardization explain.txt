Standardization is the process of scaling features so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This preprocessing step is crucial for many machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the input features. Here's why:

1. **Scale Sensitivity**: Some algorithms, like gradient descent, converge faster when features are on a similar scale. If one feature has a range of 0 to 1 and another has a range of 0 to 1000, the algorithm might prioritize the latter simply because of its larger scale, even if it's not necessarily more important.

2. **Distance-Based Algorithms**: For algorithms that rely on distances (like k-means clustering or k-nearest neighbors), features with larger scales disproportionately influence the results. For example, if you're clustering data points based on height and salary, the vast differences in the scale of salaries (thousands or more) versus heights (usually less than a few meters) would mean the algorithm mostly groups by salary and largely ignores height.

3. **Regularization**: Regularization techniques add a penalty on the magnitude of the coefficients. If features are not standardized, the penalty might affect smaller-scale features more than it should.

### Real-World Example:

Imagine you're a bank using a machine learning model to predict whether a loan applicant will default on their loan based on two main features:

1. **Annual Income**: Values typically ranging from $20,000 to $100,000.
2. **Credit Score**: Typically scaled between 300 and 850.

If you were to plot these features on a graph without standardization, the x-axis (representing income) would span a much wider range of values than the y-axis (representing credit scores). Consequently, any distance-based algorithm would be heavily influenced by the income values, as the distances in the income direction would be much larger than those in the credit score direction.

By standardizing, you're essentially making sure that both annual income and credit score have equal weight in the model's eyes, allowing for a more balanced and potentially more accurate decision on loan default predictions. 

In essence, standardizing can make the difference between a model that's heavily biased towards income in its predictions and a model that appropriately balances both income and credit score when making decisions.
